The SparkFun Qwiic LPS28DFW Absolute Digital Barometer offers a unique barometer breakout featuring the LPS28DFW from STMicroelectronics<sup>&copy;</sup>. The LPS28DFW is an absolute barometer with a water-resistant package making it perfect for pressure measurement applications where the sensor is exposed to or even submerged in water. The Qwiic system allows for integration into your I<sup>2</sup>C system with no soldering required. This Qwiic breakout also includes 0.1"-spaced PTH pins connected to the sensor's communication interface and interrupt pins for applications that require a traditional soldered connection.

The sensor has two full-scale measurement ranges of 260 - 1260hPa and 260 - 4060hPa with an absolute pressure accuracy of 0.5hPa. The LPS28DFW is composed of a piezoresistive pressure sensor with a metal lid and gel encasing to protect the sensing elements from water and other environmental hazards.
